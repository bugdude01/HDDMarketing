Numerous sites in one place.

This was an attempt a number of years ago to house several sites in one place serving a number of needs at the 
same time. With the CSS, images and other small areas of code available to all sites, it made things easier to 
manage. Still quite laborious in terms of coding but I think I was kind of heading in the right direction.
