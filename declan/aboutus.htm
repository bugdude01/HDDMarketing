As a family we were always keen to contribute when and where we could to others raising money for good causes and we continue to do so. It was only recently that some mums from our older children's school announced that they were organizing an event to help raise funds for the deposit for Declan's next car. Declan will soon be in a much larger wheelchair and his transport needs are also growing; this time we need a van which requires a MUCH larger deposit than a car AND adaptations. </p><p>Initially we were uncomfortable but we realised that these were friends and neighbours who were willing to put themselves out for us. It would be incredibly selfish for us to deny them the opportunity to help us.</p><p>A MASSIVE thank you goes out to all those who have been involved. Your efforts are sincerely appreciated. </p><h2 align="center">Thank you for your support!</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2></div><div class="footer">© Copyright 2011 HDD Marketing.</div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ?
