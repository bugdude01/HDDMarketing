After many, many complications, it was announced that he had suffered loss of oxygen and so was given hours to live. Despite the gloomy outlook and being asked to sign a DNR, Declan proved all the top doctors wrong and pulled through but we knew life was going to be hard. At 6 months old, we were given the diagnosis of Athetoid Cerebral Palsy.</p><p>The term cerebral palsy covers a number of conditions where the brain doesn't work properly, resulting in problems with movement, posture and coordination. Each person with cerebral palsy is affected in a different way.</p><p>(Dr Trisha Macnair last medically reviewed this article in August 2010)</p><p>As Declan gets older, his mobility needs become more complex and so we are raising money in order to help with the deposit for a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle and effective mobility and sensory equipment. </p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Help to support us</h2><p>In order to help raise the necessary funds to address the multiple needs that Declan has, there are various activities that you can either get involved with, sponsor us for or just make a contribution.
